Py-Git-Pub README
-----------------

This is a simple python app which does the following:
- [ ] Read from the github firehose
- [ ] Publishes the data to Kafka raw
- [ ] Stats endpoint
- [ ] Health endpoint
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Commandline params
- [ ] Config file

It should not do any data inspection unless for the most absolute basic of
filtering or statistics. The stats should be meant for health and performance,
not for data inspection.

## Deps
```shell

```
